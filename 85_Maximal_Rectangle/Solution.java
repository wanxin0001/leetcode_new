Given a 2D binary matrix filled with 0's and 1's, find the largest rectangle containing only 1's and return its area.

For example, given the following matrix:

1 0 1 0 0
1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 1 0
Return 6.

Reference: https://discuss.leetcode.com/topic/6650/share-my-dp-solution
The DP solution proceeds row by row, starting from the first row. Let the maximal rectangle area at row i and column j be computed by [right(i,j) - left(i,j)]*height(i,j).

All the 3 variables left, right, and height can be determined by the information from previous row, and also information from the current row. So it can be regarded as a DP solution. The transition equations are:

left(i,j) = max(left(i-1,j), cur_left), cur_left can be determined from the current row
right(i,j) = min(right(i-1,j), cur_right), cur_right can be determined from the current row
height(i,j) = height(i-1,j) + 1, if matrix[i][j]=='1';
height(i,j) = 0, if matrix[i][j]=='0'
The code is as below. The loops can be combined for speed but I separate them for more clarity of the algorithm.
